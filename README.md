### :man_technologist: About

Hi, I'm Dmitry and I'm a Backend Developer.

My journey in IT began with an internship in the "Linux Administration" course by IBA Group, where I underwent intensive training. After completing the internship, I spent a couple of months exploring various areas in IT, but backend development caught my attention the most. Currently, I am self-learning and actively searching for job opportunities. In addition, I assist newcomers in mastering backend development, contributing to the developer community.
